Passengers wander around the museum for a while, then line up to take a ride in a safari car. When a car is available, it loads the one passenger it can hold and rides around the park for a random amount of time. If the n cars are all out riding passengers around, then a passenger who wants to ride waits; if a car is ready to load but there are no waiting passengers, then the car waits. Use semaphores to synchronize the m passenger processes and the n car processes. The following skeleton code was found on a scrap of paper on the floor of the exam room. Grade it for correctness. Ignore syntax and missing variable declarations. Remember that P and V correspond to semWait and semSignal. <CODE>",Analyze

"In a queueing system, new jobs must wait for a while before being served. While a job waits, its priority increases linearly with time from zero at a rate a. A job waits until its priority reaches the priority of the jobs in service; then, it begins to share the processor equally with other jobs in service using round robin while its priority continues to increase at a slower rate b. The algorithm is referred to as selfish round robin, because the jobs in service try (in vain) to monopolize the processor by increasing their priority continuously. Use Figure 9.19 to show that the mean response time Rx for a job of service time x is given by: where Rx s +x-s 1 - r 1 - r r ls r assuming that arrival and service times are exponentially distributed with means 1/ and s, respectively.

"In a queueing system, new jobs must wait for a while before being served. While a job waits, its priority increases linearly with time from zero at a rate a. A job waits until its priority reaches the priority of the jobs in service; then, it begins to share the processor equally with other jobs in service using round robin while its priority continues to increase at a slower rate b. The algorithm is referred to as selfish round robin, because the jobs in service try (in vain) to monopolize the processor by increasing their priority continuously. Use Figure 9.19 to show that the mean response time Rx for a job of service time x is given by: where Rx s +x-s 1 - r 1 - r r ls r assuming that arrival and service times are exponentially distributed with means 1/ and s, respectively.

"Nowadays, online shopping has becomepopular among youngsters and teenagers through online shoppingplatforms like Flipkart, Amazon, Myntra, etc. The users haveadvertisements popped up on their screens based on their recentsearch history. However, such advertisements may not necessarilybelong to exact products that the user may want. Classification ofthe customer can be helpful in targeting a specific customer for aspecific product. This can remove those irrelevant ads that do notsuit for a customer or for which particular customer will not beinterested at all. Also, irrelevant ads floated to the customermight lead to losing a customer as a customer may get irritated ofit. Identifying the right customer and providing the right serviceat right time and treating different types of customers differentlyis the key to success in business. Customer classification isuseful for insurance companies for selling insurance. In financialmarketing, it is useful for classifying customer based on the typeof service they used. Similarly in banking, it can help identifycustomers and decide whether credit card should be issued to aspecific customer, whether the loan should be given and it can alsohelp in detecting a suspicious customer. Customer classificationcan also be used for dividing network bandwidth based on customerperformance. Such classification will aid in identifying the mostprofitable customers. xyz.com company wants to develop an e-commerce web applicationwhich emphasises the customer service.
